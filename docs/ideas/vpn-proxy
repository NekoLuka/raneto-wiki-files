Title: VPN proxy
---

# VPN proxy
A tunnel to proxy your VPN traffic to your homelab without either exposing your public IP or relying on mesh networks.
This is a simple system where you deploy the server on a VPS and the client in your homelab. 
The client is also your wireguard server, so your traffic is always unreadable for the server.

## Technical implementation
Deploy FRPS on the VPS, FRPC on the homelab as well as a wireguard server
